## Description

The programs in this repository focus on variadic functions, a feature in C that allows functions to accept a variable number of arguments. Each program illustrates different use cases and scenarios where variadic functions can be beneficial.

## Requirements

To run and compile the programs in this repository, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Make

## Compilation

Compile the programs using the provided `Makefile`. Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
make all
```

This will compile all the programs in the repository.

## Usage

After compilation, run the compiled programs as follows:

```bash
./program_name
```

Replace `program_name` with the name of the specific program you wish to run.

## File Descriptions

- `0-sum_them_all.c`: Function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
- `1-print_numbers.c`: Function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
- `2-print_strings.c`: Function that prints strings, followed by a new line.
- ...

Add a brief description of each file and its purpose.
