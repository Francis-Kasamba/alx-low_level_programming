# 0x0A. C - argc, argv

## Project Description
This C project focuses on understanding and working with the `argc` and `argv` parameters in the `main` function. These parameters are commonly used in C programs to handle command-line arguments. The project provides practical exercises and examples to enhance your understanding of how to use these parameters effectively.
