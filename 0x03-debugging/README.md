README 0x03 - C Debugging
Introduction
This document provides an overview of debugging techniques in the C programming language. Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in your code. Effective debugging is essential for producing reliable and high-quality software.

Common Types of Bugs
Before diving into debugging techniques, it's essential to understand the common types of bugs you might encounter in your C programs. These can include:

Syntax Errors: Errors in the structure of your code that prevent it from compiling.
Runtime Errors: Errors that occur during program execution, such as segmentation faults or null pointer dereferences.
Logical Errors: Errors that result in incorrect program behavior but do not necessarily crash the program.
Debugging Tools
There are several tools and techniques available for debugging C code:

Print Debugging
Print debugging involves inserting print statements (e.g., printf) in your code to output variable values and messages at specific points in your program. This can help you trace the flow of your program and identify issues.

c
Copy code
printf("Debug message: Value of x is %d\n", x);
GDB (GNU Debugger)
GDB is a powerful command-line debugger for C and many other programming languages. It allows you to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through your code line by line.

To use GDB:

bash
Copy code
$ gdb ./your_program
(gdb) break main
(gdb) run
(gdb) next
Valgrind
Valgrind is a tool for memory analysis and profiling. It can help you identify memory leaks, access violations, and other memory-related errors in your C programs.

To use Valgrind:

bash
Copy code
$ valgrind ./your_program
Debugging Tips
Start by reproducing the bug consistently.
Narrow down the scope of the issue to isolate the problematic code.
Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to track changes and revert to a known working state if needed.
Write unit tests to catch and prevent bugs early.
Collaborate with others, as a fresh set of eyes can often spot issues you've missed.
Best Practices
Document your code thoroughly to make it easier for yourself and others to understand and debug.
Use meaningful variable and function names.
Avoid using global variables, as they can make debugging more challenging.
Keep your code modular and well-structured.
