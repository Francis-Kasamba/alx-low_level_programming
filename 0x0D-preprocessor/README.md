0x0D. C - Preprocessor

## Description

This repository contains solutions to tasks related to the C preprocessor. Each task is designed to enhance your understanding of the preprocessor directives and their usage in C programming.

## Directories

- **0-main.c**: Main C file for testing the functions.
- **0-object_like_macro.h**: Header file defining a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.
- **1-pi.h**: Header file defining a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.
- **2-main.c**: Main C file for testing the inclusion of a header file.
- **3-function_like_macro.h**: Header file defining a macro named `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.
- **4-sum.h**: Header file defining a macro named `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
- **100-main_opcodes.c**: Main C file for printing the opcodes of its own main function.
- **101-preprocessor_abuse.c**: A file that prints "Hello, Holberton" using preprocessor directives only, without any main function or comments.

## Files
