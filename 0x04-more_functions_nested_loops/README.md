# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

## Introduction

This repository contains C programs that focus on utilizing functions and working with nested loops. These programs were created as part of the "0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops" project for a C programming course.

## Requirements

To compile and run the programs in this repository, you need:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, WSL, etc.)

## File Descriptions

The repository contains the following C programs:

1. `0-positive_or_negative.c`: This program prints whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.

2. `1-last_digit.c`: This program prints the last digit of a randomly generated number and checks if it is greater than 5, less than 6 but not 0, or 0.

3. `2-print_alphabet.c`: This program prints the lowercase alphabet using a loop.

4. `3-print_alphabets.c`: This program prints the lowercase and uppercase alphabets using nested loops.

5. `4-print_alphabt.c`: This program prints the lowercase alphabet, excluding 'q' and 'e'.

6. `5-print_numbers.c`: This program prints all single-digit numbers using a loop.

7. `6-print_numberz.c`: This program prints all single-digit numbers without using variables of type `char`.

8. `7-print_tebahpla.c`: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order.

9. `8-print_base16.c`: This program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.

10. `9-print_comb.c`: This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

11. `10-print_comb2.c`: This program prints combinations of two two-digit numbers, separated by a comma.

12. `100-print_comb3.c`: This program prints all possible combinations of two different digits.

13. `101-print_comb4.c`: This program prints all possible combinations of three different digits.

14. `102-print_comb5.c`: This program prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers such that the first number is less than the second number.

## Usage

To compile and run any of the programs, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory of the specific program you want to compile.

```shell
cd 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops
```

3. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).

```shell
gcc -o program_name program_name.c
```

4. Run the compiled program.

```shell
./program_name
```
