## Introduction

In the world of C programming, function pointers play a crucial role in creating versatile and modular code. This project dives into the fundamentals of function pointers, demonstrating how to declare, initialize, and use them effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. You can use [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or any other C compiler of your choice.

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x0F-Function-Pointers.git
cd 0x0F-Function-Pointers
```

Compile the C files:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o function_pointers
```

Execute the compiled program:

```bash
./function_pointers
```

## Usage

This project includes various C files that demonstrate different aspects of function pointers. The code is organized to help you understand the concepts step by step.

Explore the code files to see how function pointers are declared, initialized, and used in different scenarios.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of what you'll find in this project:

- [Example 1: Basic function pointers](examples/example1.c)
- [Example 2: Function pointers as arguments](examples/example2.c)
- [Example 3: Function pointers in structs](examples/example3.c)

Feel free to experiment with the examples and modify the code to deepen your understanding.
